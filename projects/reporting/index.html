                          <p>Besides the standard ones (SQL, MDX, Pentaho Metadata, etc.), we can also consume Kettle Transformations on the fly, so there are no limits to where your data comes from or how source data are combined together.</p>

                          <p>Pentaho Reporting is used across all industries and the public sector, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses. Pentaho's reporting capabilities are easy enough for smaller companies, but offer the greater flexibility needed to integrate well, even in the complex IT solutions of the largest companies.</p>

                          <h4>Can I use Pentaho Reporting out-of-the-box?</h4>
                          <p>Yes. It was designed to be used as an out-of-the-box reporting application and as a reporting component to integrate with other applications. Some companies will simply want to download the project in a standalone manner and start building, scheduling and distributing reports, while others will want to embed and integrate the project into their own applications, using exclusively the components they need and customizing it to fit their application.</p>

                          <h4>Can I embed Pentaho Reporting into my applications?</h4>
                          <p>Pentaho Reporting is a lightweight embeddable reporting engine that you can control from your own code to run reports and access all available data sources. Such direct embedding of the reporting engine is suitable for generating reports in the backend or for a desktop application. However, if you want to use Pentaho Reporting in a web-application, we recommend that you integrate your code with the Pentaho BI Server instead, a standard conforming J2EE application that offers a rich REST API for OEMs and developers. This allows you to combine the power of Pentaho's BI capabilities with the code of your own web-application.<br>Plus, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html" target="_blank">LGPL license</a> allows you to freely use Pentaho Reporting in commercial and open-source offerings alike.</p>

                          <p>Yes. Pentaho Reporting styling is flexible, and allows the report designer to choose the granularity at which they want to manipulate the look and feel, right down to font styling on individual characters. You can also add your own images and logos to the reports.</p>

                              <p>The Pentaho team is building an automated platform test suite and submission protocol because, well, frankly, it's a damn good idea. Until that suite is completed, if you're willing to contribute with time and resources for quality assurance testing, please <a href="mailto:community@pentaho.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. We will send you a matrix spreadsheet where you'll identify the environment, test variables in play and submit your results back to us.</p>

                              <p>Pentaho Reporting is used across all industries and the public sector, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses. Pentaho's reporting capabilities are easy enough for smaller companies, but offer the greater flexibility needed to integrate well, even in the complex IT solutions of the largest companies.</p>

                              <p>Yes. It was designed to be used as an out-of-the-box reporting application and as a reporting component to integrate with other applications. Some companies will simply want to download the project in a standalone manner and start building, scheduling and distributing reports, while others will want to embed and integrate the project into their own applications, using exclusively the components they need and customizing it to fit their application.</p>

                              <p>Pentaho Reporting is a lightweight embeddable reporting engine that you can control from your own code to run reports and access all available data sources. Such direct embedding of the reporting engine is suitable for generating reports in the backend or for a desktop application. However, if you want to use Pentaho Reporting in a web-application, we recommend that you integrate your code with the Pentaho BI Server instead, a standard conforming J2EE application that offers a rich REST API for OEMs and developers. This allows you to combine the power of Pentaho's BI capabilities with the code of your own web-application.<br>Plus, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html" target="_blank">LGPL license</a> allows you to freely use Pentaho Reporting in commercial and open-source offerings alike.</p>

                              <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">Yes. Pentaho Reporting styling is flexible, and allows the report designer to choose the granularity at which they want to manipulate the look and feel, right down to font styling on individual characters. You can also add your own images and logos to the reports.</p>

                            The <b>Reporting Engine</b> is an embeddable JAVA reporting library that is used by the Report Designer to generate reports. The library can be used in both server-side and client-side scenarios. Originally known as JFreeReport, it was designed to follow the approach of banded reporting with absolutely positioned elements.

                          <h4>Submitting test results</h4>
                          <p>The Pentaho team is building an automated platform test suite and submission protocol because, well, frankly, it's a damn good idea. Until that suite is completed, if you're willing to contribute with time and resources for quality assurance testing, please <a href="mailto:community@pentaho.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. We will send you a matrix spreadsheet where you'll identify the environment, test variables in play and submit your results back to us.</p>
